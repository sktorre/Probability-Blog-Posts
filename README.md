# Probability and Inference Portfolio

## Overview

This is my portfolio of blog posts from the fundamentals of probability theory and statistical inference course. The topics include random variables, distributions, expectations, moments, Jensen's inequality, law of large numbers, central limit theorem, maximum likelihood, point estimation (Bayesian, frequentist and likelihood version), hypothesis and significance testing and re-samping techniques.
